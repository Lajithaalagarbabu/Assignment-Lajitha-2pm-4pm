Write down 2 benefits of using semantic tags. -->

 1.)Improve Web acessbility
 2.) Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

      Semantic tags give webpages a meaningful structure that screen readers can understand easily. 
      Users with visual impairments can navigate through <header>, <main>, and heading levels more smoothly,
      instead of facing a long list of plain <div> elements with no meaning.

      Semantic HTML also helps search engines. Crawlers identify the importance of content based on tags like <h1>,
      <section>, or <article>. This allows Google to understand the page’s topic, index it correctly, and rank it 
       higher in search results.
     
5 Research: Compare semantic tags with <div> — when should each be used? 

         Semantic tags convey clear meaning and structure for accessibility and SEO,
         while divs act as generic containers mainly for styling, layout, or grouping without meaning.
