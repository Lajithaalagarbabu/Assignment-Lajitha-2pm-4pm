//  Types of JavaScript Errors

// JavaScript mainly has three types of errors:

// 1. Syntax Error

// Happens when code rules are broken.

// Program won’t run at all.


if (x == 5 {
  console.log("Hello");
}

// 2. Runtime Error

// Happens while the program is running.

// Code is syntactically correct but fails during execution.

let x = y + 10; // y is not defined

// 3. Logical Error

// Program runs without errors, but gives wrong output.

// Hardest error to find.

let a = 10;
let b = 5;
console.log(a - b);
